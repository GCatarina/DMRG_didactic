Then, we compute the corresponding reduced density matrices on the L (R) subspaces, $\\hat{\\sigma}_\\mathrm{L}$ ($\\hat{\\sigma}_\\mathrm{R}$), by tracing out the eigenstates of the R (L) subspaces. Finally, we proceed as in the truncated iterative diagonalization, but with change of basis matrices that contain the $D$ eigenvectors of $\\hat{\\sigma}_\\mathrm{L/R}$ with highest eigenvalues.\n",
